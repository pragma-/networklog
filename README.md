# Android Network Log Monitor

_Requires rooted devices._

### **Wondering when and to where your Android apps are connecting across the Internet? Look no further! Network Log is for you!**

Network Log monitors iptables-logging to display a real-time list of which apps are making network connections, and provides statistics about those app connections.

## **Real-time log display**

The log tab shows the network packets being transmitted and their details such as:

  * source and destination addresses/ports
  * network protocol and interface
  * bytes transmitted
  * timestamp

## **Real-time network usage statistics**

The applications tab lists installed applications along with network usage statistics such as:

  * total packets and bytes sent
  * active network throughput speed in Bps/Kbps/Mbps
  * timestamp of last connection
  * list of all the unique connections made by each app
  * sortable and filterable

## **Real-time connection notifications**

The statusbar icon's up/down arrows will highlight when upload/download traffic occurs, and the notification drop-down shade displays the connection throughput speed in Kbps.

You can also configure toast pop-up notifications on a per-app basis that will pop-up a temporary notification containing connection details no matter which app you are in.

## **Graphs**

Click an app in either tab to see time-lines of its connections.

Select the 'Apps Timeline' menu item to see an over-all time-line of all apps.

Adjustable interval from 1 ms to 48 hours for summing data:

  * to see each packet, set to 1 ms
  * for Kbps, set to 1 second
  * for Kb-per-hour, set to 1 hour; etc

Adjustable **_pinch-zoomable_** and **_scrollable_** graphs.

_Requires rooted devices._

_Note: While the app itself is designed to use minimal CPU/battery, you can further reduce the CPU/battery use by exiting the app after starting the logging service._
